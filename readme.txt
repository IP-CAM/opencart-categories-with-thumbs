@tik Categories with thumbnails

Purpose
=======

The purpose of this extension is exceedingly simple.

After you install this extension, it changes the behavior of the Category module. If you place the Category module in left or right column, it appears unchanged; however, if you place the Category module in content_bottom or content_top position, then it shows thumbnail images for the categories. Additionally, in the content_bottom and content_top positions, the module does not show subcategories.

Shop owners will find this module particularly helpful if they want to show all main categories on the shop home.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
